# AI Diplomacy Enhancement - Experiment Log

**Goal:** Integrate improvements for game state tracking, order validation, strategic map analysis, agent state, planning, and negotiation into the AI Diplomacy codebase while maintaining high quality and avoiding downtime.

**Changes Summary (Tasks Completed):**
- Task 1: Enhanced Game History Tracking (Phase/Experience)
- Task 2: Improved Order Validation/Processing (Normalization)
- Task 3: Strategic Map Analysis (Graph/BFS)
- Task 4: Upgraded Agent Architecture (Stateful Agent Class)
- Task 5: Enhanced Negotiation Protocol (Agent State Integration)
- Task 7: Enhanced Prompt Structure (System Prompts)
- Task 9: Implemented Planning Module
- Task 10: Improved Phase Summaries and Display

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Agent State:** `ai_diplomacy/agent.py` (DiplomacyAgent class stores personality, goals, relationships, journal). System prompts loaded from `ai_diplomacy/prompts/system_prompts/`.
- **Planning:** `ai_diplomacy/planning.py` (planning_phase uses Agent), `ai_diplomacy/agent.py` (generate_plan), `ai_diplomacy/clients.py` (get_plan), `ai_diplomacy/prompts/planning_instructions.txt`.
- **Negotiation:** `ai_diplomacy/negotiations.py` (conduct_negotiations uses Agent state), `ai_diplomacy/clients.py` (get_conversation_reply accepts Agent state), `ai_diplomacy/prompts/conversation_instructions.txt`, `ai_diplomacy/prompts/context_prompt.txt`.
- **Game History:** `ai_diplomacy/game_history.py` (stores plans, messages, etc.)
- **Utilities:** `ai_diplomacy/utils.py` (order normalization), `ai_diplomacy/map_utils.py` (graph analysis)
- **Phase Summaries:** `lm_game.py` (phase_summary_callback), modified Game class to properly record and export summaries.

## Experiment 4: Initial State & Update Loop Debug

**Date:** 2025-04-07
**Goal:** Fix initial goal generation failure and ensure state update loop runs.
**Changes:** 
- Added default neutral relationships in `Agent.__init__`.
- Added `Agent.initialize_agent_state` using LLM (called from `lm_game`).
- Added error handling/logging to `Agent.analyze_phase_and_update_state`.
**Observation:** Initial goals still `None specified` due to `TypeError` in `build_context_prompt` call within `initialize_agent_state`. Relationships defaulted correctly. State update loop (`analyze_phase_and_update_state`) was *not* being called in `lm_game.py`.
**Result:** Failure (-$0.00, minimal LLM calls due to error)
**Next Steps:** Add debug logs to `initialize_agent_state` call; Implement the state update loop call in `lm_game.py` after `game.process()`.
