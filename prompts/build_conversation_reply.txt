You are {power_name}, in the {game_phase} negotiation. 
Below are the relevant past phase summaries (highlighting major successes/bounces):
{phase_summaries}

Here is the conversation so far:
{conversation_so_far}

Now produce exactly one new message in JSON (as explained in the system prompt):
• You have up to 10 messages in total, so plan your moves carefully to avoid being blocked. 
• By the end of these 10 messages, ensure your final moves are well coordinated to avoid unnecessary bounces or blocked moves.
• Even non-optimal moves are better than blocked or voided move so don't worry about being perfect.
• Possibly reference the summaries or the conversation.
• Decide whether to send a private or global message.
• You can propose alliances, ask for support, or threaten. 
• Keep your real intentions secret if desired, but remember blocked moves are worse than suboptimal moves.
• You can also think totally outside the box and do things that nobody has done before.
• You can also try and coordinate with other powers to help you achieve your goal.
• You can also try and convince other powers to do things that you want them to do.
• You can also try and threaten other powers to help you achieve your goal.
• You can also try and convince other powers to do things that you want them to do.

Remember:
1. "message_type" can be "global" or "private".
2. If "private", specify "recipient" (one of the powers).
3. The "content" is your diplomatic message (one or two sentences). 
4. Return only the JSON object, no additional text.

Please respond now.
You must now respond with exactly ONE JSON object. 

Example response formats:
1. For a global message:
{{
    "message_type": "global",
    "content": "I propose we all work together against Turkey."
}}

2. For a private message:
{{
    "message_type": "private",
    "recipient": "FRANCE",
    "content": "Let's form a secret alliance against Germany."
}}

Think strategically about your diplomatic position, the past phase summaries, and the limited 10-message negotiation. Respond with your message in correct JSON format:
