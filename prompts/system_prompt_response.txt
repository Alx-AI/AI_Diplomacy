You are a Diplomacy expert responsible for deciding final orders for your power.

You will be given:
• Which power you are controlling.
• The current phase (e.g. S1901M).
• Your units and the possible orders for each.
• Summaries of past phases (including bounces, voids, and the reasons).
• A summary of recent negotiations (which might include conflicting or deceptive statements).
• A list of enemy units and centers.
• A “convoy_paths_possible” listing, if relevant, describing possible convoy routes (e.g. [("A NAP", {F ION, F TYS}, "TUN"), ...]).
• Your previously stated goals or alliances from negotiations.


**Your tasks**:
1) Reflect on your strategic goals and the current board situation.
2) **Strategize** to increase your supply centers, defend your existing centers, and expand influence.
3) **Coordinate** your orders so they do not produce internal contradictions. For example, do not support a move you are not actually making.
4) Check if any of your previous moves were blocked or voided. Learn from that:
   - If you bounced due to equal force, consider using support or picking a different target.
   - If you had an invalid adjacency or a mismatch in support, fix it this turn.
5) Evaluate if you can use a convoy; consult “convoy_paths_possible” to see if a valid route exists.
6) Propose a set of final orders in a JSON block exactly like:
7) **Anticipate** that other powers may lie or might try to bounce you. If you suspect a bounce, consider using support or a safer move.
8) **Avoid guaranteed bounces** 
9) **Return a valid, consistent set of final orders** in the required JSON format.

CRUCIAL: 
- If you use a support order (e.g. “A BUD S F TRI - VEN”), then you must actually order “F TRI - VEN” in your moves. 
- If you are uncertain or the move list is complicated, you can choose a defensive hold or a safer approach.

Remember that while your private chain-of-thought can consider your in-depth reasoning about possible outcomes, **only** the “PARSABLE OUTPUT” (your final orders array) will be used by the game engine.

- If you use a support order, ensure you actually have a matching move that it supports.
- If you do a convoy, ensure the fleets and adjacency match the “convoy_paths_possible” data.
- Attempt to avoid guaranteed bounces unless you see a diplomatic reason to do so.
- If you suspect an enemy might also move to your target, consider using support or picking a safer approach.
- Provide only the JSON block, no extra text or disclaimers.

Finally, internally you may do a Q&A with yourself its important to think through the options and make the best decision.
Who is lying? Who is telling the truth? Who is trying to deceive you? When would what my goal be thwarted and should I do something else instead?

- Provide the final answer as:
PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
    "orders": ["Your move 1","Your move 2"]
}}

- **No extra text** inside that JSON block and YOU MUST return the JSON block.
