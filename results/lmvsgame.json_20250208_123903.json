France maintained a defensive posture with holds in Marseille and its other positions, even as it added a new fleet (F ENG) and army (A BUR) replacing lost units, adjusting its influence on ENG and BUR. Germany saw its fleet from Kiel successfully move to Holland (HOL) while its armies in Munich and Berlin supported each other and held their positions.

Finally, Turkey held all its positions with its fleet in Ankara and armies in Constantinople and Smyrna remaining unmoved.
