On the French side, a new army was built in PAR (adding to France’s centers) while the orders involving A PIC moving toward BUR (aided by support from PAR) and the maneuver from SPA into MAR were executed without incident, leaving the other units (including the fleet in BRE) holding their positions. Germany’s orders were all dedicated to either holding or providing support (for example, A KIE’s support for A MUN’s hold) so that none of its units – deployed in DEN, HOL, MUN, KIE, or SIL – shifted locations this turn. Italy’s attempt to move its army from APU into VEN bounced, leaving that unit in place, while its fleets’ orders (F ION moving toward TUN with F TYS providing support) went through unobstructed even though the final province designations remain as before.

England managed to secure a new fleet in the English Channel (F ENG) despite a failed attempt to convoy its Wal army to Belgium, leaving its units largely in place. France’s orders led to successful support moves that preserved its holdings and resulted in the gain of two new armies in Burgundy (A BUR) and Marseilles (A MAR), compensating for the loss of units from Spain and Picardy. Germany’s maneuvers, including moves from Munich and Kie, maintained its current positions in Denmark, Holstein, and other key areas although details of individual move successes remain neutral. Italy experienced mixed results with its attempt to move the Venice army to Apulia bouncing while its fleet in Tunis (F TUN) was successfully established after the loss of Ionia. Russia’s fleet from Finland reached the Baltic origin (BOT) as planned, maintaining its presence alongside its armies in Moscow and Livonia, even though it lost its previous fleet in St. Petersburg (now referred to as STP/SC).

Germany’s forces all held, including a support from RUH to A HOL, ensuring stable positions. Italy’s moves proved uneventful as A APU supported A VEN and both F TUN and F WES carried out their orders successfully. Russia managed a couple of important moves: F BAL’s advance to BOT succeeded and A WAR’s move into PRU was successful—capturing that center—while attempts by A SEV and A UKR bounced. Meanwhile, Turkey’s plans were partially disrupted; F ARM’s attempted support for F BLA was cut, which voided A ANK’s support order, though F BLA held. Overall, the phase was marked by several bounced moves and voided supports, with the most significant change being Russia’s successful takeover of PRU and repositioning of its fleet into BOT."

England’s maneuvers, including an attempted move from BEL and NWG toward NTH and a convoy from ENG toward BEL, were mostly repelled by bounces and void orders, leaving its fleet and army formation unchanged. In France, an attempted advance from MAR to GAS did not succeed (bounced) and the fleet in BRE failed to move as planned; however, the phase saw a production change with France now fielding F BRE in place of the lost F MAO. Germany’s orders were straightforward holds with no changes to its units. Italy’s orders similarly resulted in holds despite an attempted move by F MAO toward SPA/NC bouncing; notably, Italy received a new fleet in MAO to replace the lost TUN, while A APU’s support for VEN kept the army in VEN holding. Russia held solidly with all orders, and the phase was marked by a production update: Russia gained an army in PRU and a fleet in BOT while losing A WAR and F BAL, so its remaining units in SEV, UKR, STP/NC, BOT, and the new A PRU maintained their positions. Finally, Turkey’s units, including those in ANK, ARM, and BLA, successfully held their positions.

    "In this autumn move phase the major actions involved a series of holds and support maneuvers with few successful advances. Austria’s units all held their positions, ensuring that their current influence across key centers remained intact. England attempted a swap between its two fleets (F ENG and F BEL) that ended up being void, meaning neither unit advanced as planned; however, England did gain new pieces (F NWY and A YOR) and retained a solid defensive posture overall. France made a modest but important move as A PIC successfully advanced to Paris (PAR) while its other units held, further consolidating its position in its home centers. Germany relied on support—A KIE backed A BER and A RUH supported A HOL—to maintain its formation, with all units successfully holding. Italy’s orders focused on support and holds, with A APU aiding A VEN while F WES and other units remained in place, marking the gain of F WES and helping secure its southern influence. Russia’s actions were mixed: its moves from SEV and UKR bounced off each other, keeping both units from leaving their original regions, yet F BAR moved to St. Petersburg North Coast, F BAL advanced to BOT, and A WAR pushed into Prussia, netting new pieces and retaining a foothold in contested areas. Turkey managed to reposition a unit by moving A CON to Smyrna (SMY), although its F ARM was cut while attempting to support F BLA, which itself held steady. Overall, the phase was characterized by mostly defensive stances, a few failed advances (notably the Russian attempts between SEV and UKR and the English fleet swap), and selective gains that shifted unit compositions without leading to large-scale dislodgments or retreats."

  "orders": [
    "In the Spring 1920 movement phase, the action was marked by several support moves failing and a few minor shifts rather than dramatic territorial gains. Austria’s orders encountered setbacks: its fleet from Adriatic (F ADR) failed to reach Venice due to a bounce, while the army in RUM was dislodged despite holding. Their attempts to support attacks from BUD and BUL turned void, leaving most Austrian units in their original positions. Meanwhile, England’s fleets managed movement along their flanks with F BEL and F ENG shifting, and the move from A YOR toward LVP appears to have been executed without incident. In France, a successful support maneuver saw A PAR come into existence at the expense of the lost A PIC from the previous phase, while the other French units, including A MAR, A SPA, A GAS, and F BRE, held steady. Germany’s coordinated support orders (mutually supporting KIE, BER, RUH, and HOL) kept their units stable. Italy’s orders saw a mixed result where F TYS’s intended move to LYO remains unconfirmed while F WES’s attempt to sail towards SPA/SC bounced – leaving A APU and A VEN holding position. Russia’s complex set of orders – including a support from F BOT for the move from NWY toward STP, and an attempted move by A PRU into WAR – resulted in little change as units like F STP/NC and A SEV held, despite some support moves (notably via A UKR) not producing a breakthrough. Turkey’s naval support orders from F BLA and F ARM were voided, and A SMY remained on hold. In summary, aside from Austria’s dislodgement at RUM and the series of bounced moves and void supports, the board saw only subtle positional shifts. These outcomes align with the phase-to-phase changes: France gains A PAR (losing A PIC), Russia adds F BOT, F STP/NC, and A PRU (losing A WAR, F BAR, and F BAL), and Turkey secures A SMY after losing A CON."

In Italy, three attempted moves—Rome’s fleet trying to enter the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Venetian army moving to Trieste, and the fleet in the West (F WES) also aiming for Tyrrhenian Sea—bounced, leaving Italy’s units unmoved; note that Italy also experienced a change in stature, having lost its fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea (F TYS) but gained F WES as a new or replacement unit. Russia mostly held its positions, though the army from Sevastopol bounced in its attempt to move into Armenia. Lastly, Turkey’s fleet in the Black Sea attempted to support a move from Rum to Sevastopol, but that support was voided, so its units (including ARM and its army in Smyrna) simply held.

Summary:
During the Fall 1936 Movement phase, almost every power’s units largely remained in their previous positions. Austria’s orders to support and hold resulted in several support attempts coming up void (for example, the support from Vienna and Galatz were nullified), so their forces in ADR, TRI, BUL, GAL, BUD and VIE stayed where they were. England’s fleets and army had a mixed day – while the fleet from Belgium attempted to move towards the North Sea with support from the fleet in English Channel, the move of the fleet from the Norwegian Sea fell victim to a bounce. Notably, England’s overall strategic situation changed after the turn since they gained a new fleet from NWY and an army from EDI (compensating for the loss of the army in YOR and the fleet in the North Sea). 

France’s orders to push from Paris into Burgundy and other moves did not change the positions: their units in BRE, POR, SPA, MAR, and PAR remained in place. Similarly, Germany’s forces (in Berlin, Kiel, Ruhr, Holstein and Denmark) as well as Russia’s (with units in Pru, War, NWG, Sev, Rum and LVN) held firm with their orders. Italy’s attempted move of their army from Venice to Trieste bounced, leaving their units (including A VEN, F ION, F WES and A APU) in their original positions. Finally, Turkey’s attempted convoy by the fleet in the Black Sea to support an attack from Bulgaria into Romania failed (the order rendered “void”), so the Turkish units (in BLA, ARM and SMY) also stayed where they were.

Overall, while there were several interesting tactical maneuvers – including unsupported moves and bounces – there were no successful advances or captures on the board this phase beyond the adjustments in England’s unit roster reflecting their recent center gains and losses.

Summary:
In the S1938R phase, the only order executed was by Russia’s army in Sevastopol, which was ordered to retreat to Ukraine. In the process, the Russian A SEV unit was removed and replaced by a newly marked unit, denoted as *A SEV, indicating a successful repositioning during the retreat phase. Meanwhile, Turkey experienced a change as its unit in Ankara (A ANK) was lost, while it gained an army in Sevastopol (A SEV). No other orders or movements occurred for any other power, leaving the rest of the board unchanged.

Italy encountered a bounced move from A APU to VEN, but F LYO managed a successful move to TYS; this adjustment is reflected in Italy gaining F LYO (replacing the lost F WES). Russia’s orders were mixed: A LVN’s move to PRU bounced, but A RUM advanced to UKR and A UKR moved to SEV, while F BOT successfully moved to SWE. Additionally, although F NWG’s order appears as an advance, the current board state indicates Russia now fields F NWG (gaining it) and lost F BAR. Turkey’s fleet orders all held. Overall, the phase was characterized by several failed offensives and a few significant changes in fleet composition, notably for Italy and Russia, while no retreats occurred."

Other notable adjustments include England replacing its lost A YOR with an addition of A LVP, and Russia replacing A UKR with a new unit at A RUM. No retreats occurred this turn."

Germany executed a series of support moves among A BER, A KIE, A RUH, and A HOL that consolidated their positions without incident, complementing F DEN’s hold.
