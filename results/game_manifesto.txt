        "Austria built a new fleet in Adriatic (F ADR) to replace its lost fleet in Trieste, and attempted a coordinated move with its Budapest army to Serbia while also trying to support that army moving from Budapest to Trieste; however, the support from Vienna was cut (its order became void), so the intended boost did not materialize.",
        "England replaced its losses by building new units—an army in York, a fleet in English Channel, and a fleet in North Sea. The fleet in the Channel tried to move to the North Sea but bounced, meaning all new units remained in their original positions.",
        "France built two new units (an army in Burgundy and a fleet in Picardy) while losing its previous unit placements in Paris and Brest. Orders to move the new fleet from Picardy to Brest did not succeed, so the French units stayed put, with the army holding in Marseilles.",
        "Germany’s forces (Munich, Berlin, and the fleet in Kiel) held their positions. A support order from Berlin to Munich was issued but did not lead to any change, so German units remained in place.",
        "Italy constructed new forces—a new army in Apulia (attempting a convoy move to Albania via Ionian Sea) and an army in Tyrol, alongside the fleet in Ionian Sea—as part of a reconstitution after losing units in Naples, Rome, and Venice. The convoy order did not result in a relocation, so the units retained their current positions.",
        "Russia attempted to send its army in Warsaw to Ukraine with support from the Moscow army, but the support order was cut (void), and the Warsaw army remained in place. Meanwhile, Russia built a new fleet in the Black Sea (F RUM) to replace its lost fleet in Sevastopol, and its units held in the other designated areas.",
        "Turkey’s orders were straightforward as all three units (the army in Arm, the fleet in Black Sea area BLA, and the army in Bulgaria) held. Turkey replaced its lost units (from Smyrna, Ankara, and Constantinople) with these new units, maintaining its current positions."

        "In the W1901A phase, Austria’s move from Budapest (A BUD) was executed successfully while its Trieste move (A TRI) failed (void). As a result, Austria lost its unit in Budapest but added a new unit in Serbia and secured the SER center.",

{
    "summary": "During the Spring 1901 Movement phase, nearly all attempted moves failed to alter the board state. Austria’s fleet ordered to move from Trieste to Albania and its support order from Budapest for the Vienna-to-Trieste maneuver did not result in a change, leaving all units in their original positions. Similarly, England’s orders to shift its fleet and army, France’s moves and support action, Germany’s attempted advances, Italy’s moves toward the Ionian Sea and Apulia, Russia’s offensives and support, and Turkey’s actions (including a hold by its fleet in Ankara) all resolved without dislodging opposing forces or capturing new centers. In summary, no units changed locations and each power maintained its current supply centers and positions on the board."

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{
    "summary": "In phase F1901M, most attempted offensives were stymied by bounces or held positions. Austria’s attempted move from BUD to SER did not dislodge its unit, which remained at BUD, while it strengthened its presence by adding units in BOH and ALB and losing TRI and VIE. England’s forces held their posts at ENG, NTH, and YOR, consolidating a defensive stance despite a reshuffle that saw losses at EDI, LVP, and LON alongside new gains. France’s orders, which included a support from BRE for MAR’s move, resulted in a stable board with BRE, MAR, and the addition of BUR (offset by the loss of PAR). Germany’s moves—such as the attempted advance from KIE to HOL and F DEN’s push—failed to relocate units, leaving MUN, DEN, and KIE in place though the power shifted influence with the loss of BER and F KIE and gaining KIE and DEN. Italy’s coordinated support and move orders involving TYR, APU, and ION did not dislodge opponents, so its units (APU, TYR, and ION) remained in their previous positions, even as it adjusted its roster by losing VEN, NAP, and ROM. Russia’s aggressive orders met setbacks with notable bounces on A WAR and F LVN, leaving its fleet and army at WAR, UKR, BLA, and LVN, while its attempt to move F BLA to SEV also did not materialize. Meanwhile, Turkey’s units (ANK, ARM, and BUL) simply held, maintaining their established positions despite a change in their build composition. Overall, the turn was characterized by defensive postures, several failed advances, and reshuffling of unit inventories across the powers."

=== W1901A ===
During the Spring 1901 adjustment phase several significant changes occurred. Austria’s build orders did not go as planned; while attempts were made at Budapest, Trieste, and Vienna, only an army in Serbia appeared as a new unit and the center SER was gained, with the unit in BUD being lost and the orders in TRI and VIE turning void. In Germany’s case, orders aimed at Berlin and Kiel instead resulted in the creation of an army in Holstein and a fleet in the Swedish coast, with the country acquiring the HOL and SWE centers despite losing units originally in Kiel and in a position designated as DEN. France saw unit adjustments as well, gaining an army in GAS and one in PAR while losing forces previously positioned in MAR and BUR, reflecting internal rebalancing. Italy replaced its loss of an army in TYR with a successful addition in VEN, and Russia replaced a fleet in BLA with one in SEV. Finally, Turkey’s build order for a fleet in CON was successful and secured the BUL center even though its attempt to build an army in SMY turned void. Overall, the turn was marked by mixed results in build orders, with several intended units not materializing while new units and centers shifted the balance of power on the board.

        "During the S1901M phase, most attempted moves failed to alter the balance on the board. Austria’s fleet in Trieste tried moving to the Adriatic but was held, and its support order from Vienna for Budapest moving to Trieste ended up void. Likewise, Russia’s fleet in Sevastopol and Turkey’s fleet in Ank attempted moves that were both bounced. All powers, including England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey, ended up holding their positions with no successful advances or captures, leaving the unit placements and control of supply centers unchanged."
