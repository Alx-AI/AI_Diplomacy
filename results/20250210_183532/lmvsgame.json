Austria solidified its position by holding in BUD, TRI, and its newly gained BOH after losing VIE. England\u2019s units (NWG, ENG, and YOR) largely remained in place even though NWG attempted a move toward NAO and ENG toward NTH, suggesting these advances were rebuffed. France tried to expand with BRE moving toward ENG and coordinated MAR\u2019s move to GAS supported by BUR; however, none of these efforts resulted in a change of position, even as France\u2019s unit composition shifted with the gain of BUR and loss of PAR.\n\nOn the German side, although KIE attempted to provide support (for a move on RUH) that was ultimately voided, both MUN and HOL stayed put. Germany\u2019s overall composition was adjusted by gaining HOL and KIE while losing BER and its previous KIE. Italy\u2019s maneuver to send VEN to TRI bounced, and even though ION was ordered to convoy APU toward GRE, both APU and VEN were forced to remain in their starting positions, highlighting a failed attempt to contest territory. \n\nRussia also saw mixed results: while FIN\u2019s planned move to SWE held, SEV\u2019s advance toward BLA bounced. UKR and WAR held steady, maintaining Russia\u2019s influence. In Turkey\u2019s case, BLA and BUL held firm while the attempt to move CON toward BUL was bounced, even as Turkey gained BUL and BLA and lost SMY and ANK. \n\nOverall, this phase saw several attempted advances and support orders (including a voided support from Germany\u2019s KIE) that ultimately resulted in a board state where most units held their positions despite the underlying shifts in power composition from previous gains and losses."},{"name":"W1901A","state":{"timestamp":1739213237106819,"zobrist_hash":"1344712865979629783","note":"","name":"W1901A","units":{"AUSTRIA":["A BUD","F TRI","A BOH"],"ENGLAND":["A YOR","F NAO","F NTH"],"FRANCE":["A BUR","F ENG","A GAS"],"GERMANY":["A MUN","F HOL","A KIE"],"ITALY":["A VEN","F ION","A GRE"],"RUSSIA":["A WAR","F SEV","A UKR","F SWE"],"TURKEY":["F BLA","A BUL","A CON"]},"retreats":{"AUSTRIA":{},"ENGLAND":{},"FRANCE":{},"GERMANY":{},"ITALY":{},"RUSSIA":{},"TURKEY":{}},"centers":{"AUSTRIA":["BUD","TRI","VIE"],"ENGLAND":["EDI","LON","LVP"],"FRANCE":["BRE","MAR","PAR"],"GERMANY":["BER","KIE","MUN","HOL"],"ITALY":["NAP","ROM","VEN","GRE"],"RUSSIA":["MOS","SEV","STP","WAR","SWE"],"TURKEY":["ANK","CON","SMY","BUL"]},"homes":{"AUSTRIA":["BUD","TRI","VIE"],"ENGLAND":["EDI","LON","LVP"],"FRANCE":["BRE","MAR","PAR"],"GERMANY":["BER","KIE","MUN"],"ITALY":["NAP","ROM","VEN"],"RUSSIA":["MOS","SEV","STP","WAR"],"TURKEY":["ANK","CON","SMY"]},"influence":{"AUSTRIA":["BUD","VIE","TRI","BOH"],"ENGLAND":["EDI","LON","LVP","NWG","YOR","NAO","NTH"],"FRANCE":["BRE","MAR","PAR","BUR","ENG","GAS"],"GERMANY":["BER","MUN","HOL","KIE"],"ITALY":["NAP","ROM","VEN","ION","APU","GRE"],"RUSSIA":["WAR","MOS","SEV","STP","UKR","FIN","SWE"],"TURKEY":["ANK","SMY","BLA","BUL","CON"]},"civil_disorder":{"AUSTRIA":0,"ENGLAND":0,"FRANCE":0,"GERMANY":0,"ITALY":0,"RUSSIA":0,"TURKEY":0},"builds":{"AUSTRIA":{"count":0,"homes":[]},"ENGLAND":{"count":0,"homes":[]},"FRANCE":{"count":0,"homes":[]},"GERMANY":{"count":1,"homes":["BER"]},"ITALY":{"count":1,"homes":["NAP","ROM"]},"RUSSIA":{"count":1,"homes":["MOS","STP"]},"TURKEY":{"count":1,"homes":["ANK","SMY"]}},"phase":"W1901A","game_id":"k7rXi4OTc63kW_D9","map":"standard","rules":["NO_PRESS","POWER_CHOICE"]},"orders":{"AUSTRIA":[],"ENGLAND":[],"FRANCE":[],"GERMANY":["F BER B"],"ITALY":["A NAP B","F ROM B"],"RUSSIA":["F STP\/SC B"],"TURKEY":["A ANK B","A SMY B"]},"results":{"F BER":[""],"A NAP":[""],"F ROM":["void"],"F STP\/SC":[""],"A ANK":[""],"A SMY":["void"]},"messages":[],"summary":"PARSABLE OUTPUT:\n{\n    \"summary\": \"In the W1901A phase, several orders had mixed outcomes.
