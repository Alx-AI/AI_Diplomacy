    "During the F1901M phase, most attempted maneuvers did not alter unit locations, with nearly every order failing to change positions on the board.",
    "Austria’s orders—moving A BUD toward SER, having F TRI support an action involving VEN, and shifting A GAL toward BOH—ended with no unit relocation, though the nation did adjust its forces by replacing the lost unit in VIE with a new unit at GAL.",
    "England’s fleets tried to advance and support (with F ENG supporting an attack on A BUR, F NTH moving to HEL, and A LVP making a move to YOR) but ultimately maintained their positions, reflecting a rebuilding from the loss of fleets at EDI and LON while adding F ENG and F NTH.",
    "France attempted to move A BUR to BEL, with F PIC providing support and A SPA holding; even though no moves were successful, France’s composition changed as they lost units from MAR, PAR, and BRE, while gaining new forces at PIC, SPA, and BUR.",
    "Germany’s orders were exclusively holds (F HOL, A KIE, and A RUH all holding), stabilizing their positions after losing previous units from BER, MUN, and a fleet from KIE, yet reinforcing with new units.",
    "Italy’s attempted moves—A VEN toward TYR, A APU shifting to VEN, and F ION moving to GRE—failed, keeping the original locations for A VEN, F ION, and A APU. This came on the heels of losing ROM and F NAP but gaining units in ION and APU.",
    "Russia’s orders also did not result in successful movement: despite F SEV trying to move to BLA and A MOS attempting to head to STP, none of these changed, so their units remained at MOS, SEV, A SIL, and F FIN while replacing losses from WAR and a unit in St. Petersburg.",
    "Similarly, Turkey’s maneuvers—with F ANK supporting a move for F SEV, A BUL holding, and A SMY attempting to move to ARM—failed to yield changes in unit positions, keeping units at ANK, A BUL, and A SMY and adjusting after the loss of A CON.",
    "Overall, the turn was marked by little tactical movement, with most orders fizzling, but significant adjustments to the supply center holdings led to a reshaped force composition for all powers."

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{
  "orders": [
    "During the Winter 1901A build phase, the major powers undertook mixed results with their build orders. Austria’s order to build an army in Vienna appears to have succeeded, and it has reorganized its forces—adding A BOH and A SER—while losing a unit from Bud. France successfully built a fleet at Brest and an army at Paris, whereas its order to build an army in Marseilles was void. Despite that, France expanded its influence by gaining Spa and Bel and adding A BEL, while dropping a unit from Bur. Germany’s build order in Berlin went through, but its attempt to build in Munich was nullified; Germany also secured the center Hol. Italy saw similar mixed results, with the fleet build in Naples succeeding even as its army build in Rome was void. Nonetheless, Italy bolstered its forces by gaining F GRE and A TYR, and it increased its center assets by capturing Gre. Turkey managed to build a fleet in Constantinople successfully while its order to build an army in Smyrna was void; it offset this by gaining A ARM and capturing center Bul. England and Russia submitted no orders this phase, though their unit compositions have shifted following previous changes, with England adding units in York and Hel and Russia adjusting by gaining F BLA and A STP while losing units from Mos and Sev. Overall, the turn was marked by successful expansions for several powers amid a few voided build orders, leading to important shifts in unit placements and center control."

{
    "orders": [
        "In the S1901M phase, all powers issued orders with strategic intent but no unit left its starting position. Austria tried to support moves between BUD, VIE, and TRI, yet one of its support orders (from A VIE) went void, leaving its forces in place. England aimed at moving fleets from EDI and LON toward the North Sea and an army from LVP toward WAL, but despite these maneuvers, its units remained at F EDI, F LON, and A LVP. France attempted to shift its forces with F BRE moving toward MAO and both armies from MAR and PAR supporting moves into BUR, yet these orders did not alter the board configuration. Similarly, Germany’s orders to reposition its fleet, armies, and hold in BER resulted in no change, as did Italy’s orders which envisioned moves from NAP, ROM, and VEN to distant locations like ION, APU, and TYR. Russia’s maneuver orders, including the support and attempted move of A WAR (and accompanying fleet moves from SEV and STP/SC), left its units unmoved. Finally, Turkey maintained a fully defensive posture with its three units holding. Overall, while many orders were designed to support advances or reposition forces, none resulted in captures, retreats, or any changes in unit location from the existing board state."

{
  "orders": [
    "Austria attempted two offensives this turn: its army from BUD to VIE and its fleet from TRI to VEN both bounced, and its supporting move from VIE to back the BUD move ended up void. As a result, Austrian units remain at BUD, VIE, and TRI.",
    "England’s orders were much smoother. The army from WAL moved to YOR with support from the fleet at EDI, while the fleet stationed at NTH held. England now features its new A WAL unit (after losing F LON and A LVP previously) along with F EDI and F NTH.",
    "France achieved a shift in its positioning by sending the fleet from MAO to BRE successfully, with both the armies at BUR and MAR holding. This corresponds with France’s net gain of a BUR and F MAO and the loss of F BRE and A PAR.",
    "Germany coordinated a push: the army from RUH moved to MUN with crucial support from A BER, and the fleet at HOL held its ground. Consequently, Germany has now added A RUH and F HOL while losing F KIE and A MUN from before.",
    "Italy executed a supported offensive as its army from APU advanced to VEN with help from A TYR, while the fleet in ION moved to TUN. With these orders, Italy sees the introduction of A TYR, F ION, and A APU, even as it lost A ROM, A VEN, and F NAP in the previous turn.",
    "Russia’s orders were entirely defensive: all units—including F BLA, F BOT, A MOS, and A LVN—held their positions. This steady stance follows the recent changes where Russia built new units (A LVN, F BOT, F BLA) and lost others (F STP/SC, F SEV, A WAR).",
    "Turkey’s moves also met with success. The fleet at ANK provided support for F BLA (as indicated through its support order) while the army from CON moved to BUL, and the army at SMY held. Turkey’s forces retain their positions in ANK, CON, and SMY on the board."

  "orders": [
    "During phase W1901A, most powers mostly stood pat while a few minor moves reshaped the board. Germany issued an order involving its unit from KIE, and Italy attempted two orders—one with its fleet from NAP that appears to have resolved (though details aren’t fully explicit) and a second order from ROM that was declared void. There were no retreats this phase. In the overall board state, several adjustments were noted: England replaced its unit at WAL with a new unit at YOR; France lost its unit at MAO but added a fleet in BRE; Germany saw its unit from RUH removed and replaced by a unit in MUN while also expanding its territory to include HOL; Italy shed its units in ION and APU, replaced them with a fleet at TUN and an army at VEN, and secured the TUN center; and Turkey shifted from a unit in CON to gain one in BUL while taking the BUL center. These changes set the stage for future moves while preserving the overall stability of most powers."

    "France focused on a defensive posture with holds by A BUR and A MAR, while its fleet in BRE advanced toward ENG to assert pressure.",

    "This turn saw several notable shifts. Austria’s orders were mixed: while A BUD’s support for moving A VIE and the convoy attempt with F TRI were attempted, the fleet in TRI was dislodged, creating a setback in their operations. England emerged stronger by adding A LON and F HEL to their forces even as they lost F NTH and A YOR, indicating a successful rebalancing of their positions. France replaced its lost F BRE with a newly built F ENG, while holding its armies in BUR and MAR. Germany’s orders maintained the status quo, as their support moves around A MUN did not yield any substantial changes in position. Italy made a significant pivot by moving A VEN toward TRI and reinforcing with new naval units F ION and F WES, compensating for the loss of F TUN and F NAP. Russia held its positions steadily with all units on defense and support. Meanwhile, Turkey repositioned its forces by moving A ARM – now established on the board – and holding F ANK and A BUL, after losing A SMY. Overall, the turn was characterized by strategic repositioning and selective gains by several powers, notably England, France, Italy, and Turkey, while Austria faced challenges with the dislodgement of its fleet."
