  "orders": [
    "During the F1901M phase, most attempted maneuvers did not alter unit locations, with nearly every order failing to change positions on the board.",
    "Austria’s orders—moving A BUD toward SER, having F TRI support an action involving VEN, and shifting A GAL toward BOH—ended with no unit relocation, though the nation did adjust its forces by replacing the lost unit in VIE with a new unit at GAL.",
    "England’s fleets tried to advance and support (with F ENG supporting an attack on A BUR, F NTH moving to HEL, and A LVP making a move to YOR) but ultimately maintained their positions, reflecting a rebuilding from the loss of fleets at EDI and LON while adding F ENG and F NTH.",
    "France attempted to move A BUR to BEL, with F PIC providing support and A SPA holding; even though no moves were successful, France’s composition changed as they lost units from MAR, PAR, and BRE, while gaining new forces at PIC, SPA, and BUR.",
    "Germany’s orders were exclusively holds (F HOL, A KIE, and A RUH all holding), stabilizing their positions after losing previous units from BER, MUN, and a fleet from KIE, yet reinforcing with new units.",
    "Italy’s attempted moves—A VEN toward TYR, A APU shifting to VEN, and F ION moving to GRE—failed, keeping the original locations for A VEN, F ION, and A APU. This came on the heels of losing ROM and F NAP but gaining units in ION and APU.",
    "Russia’s orders also did not result in successful movement: despite F SEV trying to move to BLA and A MOS attempting to head to STP, none of these changed, so their units remained at MOS, SEV, A SIL, and F FIN while replacing losses from WAR and a unit in St. Petersburg.",
    "Similarly, Turkey’s maneuvers—with F ANK supporting a move for F SEV, A BUL holding, and A SMY attempting to move to ARM—failed to yield changes in unit positions, keeping units at ANK, A BUL, and A SMY and adjusting after the loss of A CON.",
    "Overall, the turn was marked by little tactical movement, with most orders fizzling, but significant adjustments to the supply center holdings led to a reshaped force composition for all powers."

=== W1901A ===
PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{
  "orders": [
    "During the Winter 1901A build phase, the major powers undertook mixed results with their build orders. Austria’s order to build an army in Vienna appears to have succeeded, and it has reorganized its forces—adding A BOH and A SER—while losing a unit from Bud. France successfully built a fleet at Brest and an army at Paris, whereas its order to build an army in Marseilles was void. Despite that, France expanded its influence by gaining Spa and Bel and adding A BEL, while dropping a unit from Bur. Germany’s build order in Berlin went through, but its attempt to build in Munich was nullified; Germany also secured the center Hol. Italy saw similar mixed results, with the fleet build in Naples succeeding even as its army build in Rome was void. Nonetheless, Italy bolstered its forces by gaining F GRE and A TYR, and it increased its center assets by capturing Gre. Turkey managed to build a fleet in Constantinople successfully while its order to build an army in Smyrna was void; it offset this by gaining A ARM and capturing center Bul. England and Russia submitted no orders this phase, though their unit compositions have shifted following previous changes, with England adding units in York and Hel and Russia adjusting by gaining F BLA and A STP while losing units from Mos and Sev. Overall, the turn was marked by successful expansions for several powers amid a few voided build orders, leading to important shifts in unit placements and center control."
