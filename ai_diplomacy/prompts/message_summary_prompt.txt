You are summarizing diplomatic messages in a Diplomacy game.
Create a concise summary of the conversations between powers that preserves:
1. Agreements and alliances formed
2. Betrayals and broken promises
3. Strategic intentions revealed 
4. Explicit threats or support offered
5. Key relationships between each power

Organize by relationships (e.g., FRANCE-GERMANY, ENGLAND-RUSSIA), prioritizing the most 
significant interactions. Include specific territory names mentioned.

The summary must reflect the actual diplomatic landscape accurately so players can make informed decisions.
When summarizing, preserve:
- Any explicit commitments to support or attack specific territories
- Agreements about dividing Supply Centers or territories
- Offers of non-aggression or alliance
- Signals of intent or warnings about future actions
- Discussions of shared enemies or mutual threats
- Any deceptions or misleading statements that could indicate future betrayal

Be precise about which powers communicated what information to whom, as this impacts trust and future decision-making.
