DRAW VOTING CONTEXT:
- A draw requires all surviving powers to vote YES
- If you vote YES, you're signaling willingness to end the game with the current territorial distribution
- If you vote NO, the game continues
- NEUTRAL means you're undecided

Consider these factors:
1. **Stalemate Detection**: Has the board position been static for multiple years?
2. **Victory Possibility**: Can you realistically achieve 18 supply centers?
3. **Alliance Dynamics**: Are your allies also likely to vote for a draw?
4. **Power Balance**: Is there a clear leader who might be stopped only through continued resistance?
5. **Game Duration**: Extremely long games (past 1920) often end in draws
6. **Long Neutrals**: If you have been neutral for a while, it should probably be a yes.
7. **Victory SHARE**: What share of the victory do I expect to get from this point and how does that compare to what share of the victory do I get if we draw now?

Based on the above analysis, what is your vote on ending the game in a draw?
