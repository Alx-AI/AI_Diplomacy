Based on the current game state, your goals, relationships, and the conversation history, decide if you want to send a message this round.

**Your Task:** Generate your negotiation message(s). Format EACH message as a separate JSON object.

**Output Format:**
Respond ONLY with one or more JSON objects. Do NOT include any other text, commentary, or explanation outside the JSON structure.

Each JSON object MUST have the following keys:
- "message_type": Either "global" (to send to all powers) or "private" (to send to one power).
- "content": The text content of your message.

If "message_type" is "private", you MUST also include:
- "recipient": The name of the target power (e.g., "FRANCE", "RUSSIA").

**Examples:**

Example 1: Sending a global message
{{
  "message_type": "global",
  "content": "Let's coordinate against Austria this turn. Who is with me?"
}}

Example 2: Sending a private message to Russia
{{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "RUSSIA",
  "content": "Are you willing to support my move into Vienna if I support your move into Galicia?"
}}

Example 3: Sending multiple messages (one global, one private)
{{
  "message_type": "global",
  "content": "Peace in the West seems achievable.
}}
{{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "GERMANY",
  "content": "England seems distracted. Perhaps we can pressure them together?"
}}

**Important:**
- Adhere strictly to the JSON format.
- Ensure recipient names are spelled correctly if sending private messages.
- If you choose not to send a message this round, output an empty response or just `[]`.
