**ORDER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS**

1.  **Analyze:** Review the current game state, previous orders, messages, and potential motivations of other powers provided in the context.
2.  **Reason Step-by-Step:** Before providing orders, clearly write out your thinking process. Explain your strategic goals for this phase and why you are choosing specific moves, supports, or holds.
3.  **Format Orders:** Provide your final orders exclusively within a JSON block, prefaced EXACTLY by `PARSABLE OUTPUT:`. Do not include any text after the closing brace `}}`.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
*   Your orders *must* be chosen from the `possible_orders` list provided in the context.
*   Support orders must correspond to an actual move or hold order you are issuing (e.g., `A PAR S F PIC - ENG` requires `F PIC - ENG`).
*   Adjudication is simultaneous.
*   You are only submitting orders now. Do not write messages.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Reasoning:
*   I need to secure Burgundy against potential German aggression.
*   Moving the fleet to the Mid-Atlantic opens up convoy possibilities later.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A PAR H",
    "A MAR - BUR",
    "F BRE - MAO"
  ]
}}
